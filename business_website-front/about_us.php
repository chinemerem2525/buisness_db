				<p>In 2003, Mark Zuckerberg, a second-year student in Harvard, wrote the software for a website called Facemash. He&apos;s got this exciting idea of finding ways to compare pictures of Harvard students online. He wanted to give Harvard students the opportunity to enjoy themselves by comparing their pictures online and voting for who’s hot and who’s not. That’s just his funny idea. He was so passionate about this idea that he went further to hack into Harvard website and steal student’s IDs to create his dream website, Facemash.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Harvard students were enjoying this exciting experience for few days when the school authority found out and shut down the site and expelled Zuckerberg from the School. However the visionary dude was still dreaming. His enthusiasm to create his dream website has never stopped burning.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In 2004, Zuckerberg launched a new website called TheFacebook. The website was at the verge of picking up when he was, again accused of stealing other people’s ideas. A lawsuit was filed against him but the matter was later settled out of court. His dream finally came true. TheFacebook started gaining visibility and acceptance. The little dream that seem immaterial started growing beyond imagination.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This year (2020), Zuckerberg networth is estimated to $70.3 billion USD. Damn it! Can you beat that? That guy is obviously richer than the world Nigerian billionaires put together. Are you kidding me!</p>
